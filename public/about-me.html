<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p> As a Software Engineer in Test at Selenium Master LLC, I have been applying my technical expertise in test automation to web-based applications for 2.5 years. I have successfully tested more than 100 tests for our Adobe E-commerce project, using tools such as Selenium, Java, Gherkin, and Jira. I have also written test cases, prepared traceability matrix, and written bug reports with high quality and efficiency.</p>

<p> In addition to my test automation skills, I have over 15 years of experience in foreign trade, logistic, and business development. I have worked as an Overseas Purchasing Director and an Import Expert for leading companies in Turkey and China, managing and improving the quality, cost, and delivery of raw materials, semi-products, and production machines. I have also cooperated with planning, production, and QA departments to ensure the smooth operation and customer satisfaction of our products. These diverse experiences have made me more patient, solution-oriented, and quick to learn new skills.</p>
